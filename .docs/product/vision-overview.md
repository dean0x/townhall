# Townhall: A Git-Inspired CLI for Structured Agent Interactions

## Product Vision

Townhall is a local version control system that enables agents to log, track, and structure their interactions during simulations. Like Git tracks code changes, Townhall tracks agent actions, arguments, and decisions within structured simulation frameworks. It provides agents with simulation-specific commands to record their contributions while maintaining full traceability and relationships between all interactions.

## Core Concept Translation

| Git Concept | Townhall Equivalent | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Repository | Simulation Space | Container for all simulation records |
| Commit | Agent Action | Immutable record of an agent's contribution |
| Branch | Active Simulation | Specific simulation instance with its type |
| File | Argument/Response | Individual agent's logged content |
| Tree | Debate Round | Collection of related arguments |
| Log | Simulation History | Chronological record of agent actions |
| Diff | Argument Comparison | Differences between positions |
| Blame | Attribution | Track which agent made which argument |
| Checkout | Enter Simulation | Switch context to specific simulation |

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Structured Interaction Logging**
Agents don't just save text - they log structured actions appropriate to the simulation type:
- Debate: Arguments with types (deductive, inductive, rebuttal)
- Decision Making: Evaluations, criteria, votes
- Brainstorming: Ideas with categories and links
- Each action maintains context and relationships

### 2. **Simulation-Aware Commands**
When in a simulation branch, agents access commands specific to that simulation type:
- Debate simulations: `argument`, `rebuttal`, `concession`, `vote`
- Decision simulations: `evaluate`, `propose`, `object`, `approve`
- Commands enforce structure and capture metadata

### 3. **Complete Traceability**
Every agent action is tracked with:
- Agent identity (who made the argument)
- Temporal order (when in the debate)
- Relationships (what it responds to)
- Content and reasoning
- Supporting evidence and citations

## Value Propositions

### For AI Researchers
- **Structured Data Collection**: Agents log actions in analyzable formats
- **Interaction Analysis**: Study how agents respond to each other
- **Debate Quality**: Track argument strength and logical flow
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful argumentation strategies

### For Agent Developers
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent commands across simulations
- **Context Awareness**: Agents know their simulation context
- **Relationship Tracking**: See what arguments agents respond to
- **Role Clarity**: Each agent's contributions clearly identified

### For Simulation Orchestrators
- **Process Control**: Define and enforce simulation structure
- **State Management**: Track where simulations are in their flow
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure participation and contribution quality
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all agent actions

## Core Principles

### 1. **Agent Autonomy**
Agents control their own contributions:
- Agents decide when to log actions
- Each agent maintains their identity
- No automatic simulation execution
- Agents drive the process

### 2. **Structural Integrity**
Simulations follow defined structures:
- Type-specific command sets
- Enforced debate/decision flows
- Relationship preservation
- Order and context maintained

### 3. **Local First**
Everything happens locally:
- No network dependencies
- Fast operations
- Privacy by default
- Complete control

### 4. **Traceability**
Every action is traceable:
- Who (agent identity)
- What (action content)
- When (temporal order)
- Why (relationships and reasoning)

## Example: Debate Simulation

When agents participate in a debate about AI regulation:

```bash
# User creates a debate simulation
townhall simulate debate ai-regulation

# Agent A enters the simulation
townhall checkout ai-regulation

# Agent A makes opening argument
townhall argument --type deductive --opens \
  "Premise 1: Human rights must be protected.
   Premise 2: Unregulated AI can violate rights.
   Conclusion: AI must be regulated."

# Agent B enters and responds
townhall checkout ai-regulation
townhall rebuttal --responds-to @A:1 --type empirical \
  "Studies show innovation thrives without regulation.
   Evidence: Internet growth 1990-2000."

# Agent A counter-rebuts with citation
townhall rebuttal --responds-to @B:1 --cites "MIT-Study-2023" \
  "The Internet analogy fails because AI has
   fundamentally different risk profiles."

# View debate structure
townhall log --graph
```

The system tracks:
- Argument types and logical structure
- Response relationships
- Citations and evidence
- Agent positions
- Temporal flow

- Agent identity tracking
- Simulation context

## Key Differentiators

### From Git
- **Active Logging**: Agents log during execution, not after
- **Typed Actions**: Not just text, but structured arguments
- **Simulation Context**: Commands change based on simulation type
- **No Remotes**: Local-first, no network complexity

### From Existing Tools
- **Structure**: Enforces debate/decision protocols
- **Relationships**: Tracks what responds to what
- **Identity**: Clear agent attribution
- **Simplicity**: Git-like interface, easy to learn

## Conclusion

Townhall adapts Git's powerful version control concepts to provide structured logging for agent interactions. By giving agents simulation-aware commands and tracking relationships between their actions, we enable rich analysis of multi-agent behaviors. This isn't just loggingâ€”it's a foundation for understanding how agents debate, decide, and collaborate.
