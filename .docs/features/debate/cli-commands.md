# Townhall CLI Command Reference: Debate Simulation

## Overview
Townhall provides a Git-inspired CLI for agents to log structured actions during simulations. This reference focuses on debate simulations where agents make arguments, respond to each other, and build a traceable interaction history.

## Core Commands

### townhall init
Initialize a new Townhall repository
```bash
townhall init [directory]

# Examples
townhall init                    # Initialize in current directory
townhall init debates            # Create and initialize new directory

# Creates:
# .townhall/
#   ├── config
#   ├── HEAD
#   ├── simulations/
#   ├── agents/
#   └── index
```

### townhall simulate
Create a new simulation
```bash
townhall simulate <type> <name>

# Arguments
  type              Simulation type (debate, decision, brainstorm, etc.)
  name              Unique identifier for the simulation

# Examples
townhall simulate debate ai-regulation
townhall simulate debate climate-policy
townhall simulate debate tech-monopolies

# Output
Created simulation 'ai-regulation' (type: debate)
To enter this simulation, run: townhall checkout ai-regulation
```

### townhall checkout
Enter a simulation context
```bash
townhall checkout <simulation-name>

# Examples
townhall checkout ai-regulation

# Output
Switched to simulation 'ai-regulation' (type: debate)
Current stage: opening
Available commands: argument, citation, log, status

# After checkout, debate-specific commands become available
```

### townhall status
Show current context and available actions
```bash
townhall status

# When not in simulation
$ townhall status
Not in any simulation.
Available simulations:
  - ai-regulation (debate) - 15 arguments
  - climate-policy (debate) - 8 arguments

# When in simulation
$ townhall status
Simulation: ai-regulation (debate)
Stage: rebuttal
Your role: agent_proponent
Arguments made: 5
Last action: 2 minutes ago

Available commands:
  - argument: Make an argument
  - rebuttal: Respond to an argument
  - citation: Add evidence
  - concession: Acknowledge a point
```

### townhall list
List all simulations
```bash
townhall list [options]

# Options
  --type <type>     Filter by simulation type
  --active          Show only active simulations
  --archived        Show archived simulations

# Examples
townhall list
townhall list --type debate
townhall list --active

# Output
NAME              TYPE      STATUS    ACTIONS  CREATED
ai-regulation     debate    active    23       2024-01-15 10:00
climate-policy    debate    completed 45       2024-01-14 14:30
tech-monopolies   debate    active    12       2024-01-15 09:00
```

## Debate-Specific Commands

These commands are only available when checked out to a debate simulation.

### townhall argument
Make a structured argument
```bash
townhall argument [options] <content>

# Options
  --type <type>         Argument type (required)
                        deductive: Premise-based logic
                        inductive: Evidence generalization
                        empirical: Data-driven
                        analogical: Comparison-based
                        ethical: Value-based

  --opens               Opening argument (no prior response)
  --responds-to <id>    ID of argument being addressed
  --position <pos>      Your position (pro/con/neutral)
  --cites <sources>     Comma-separated citation IDs

# Examples

# Opening deductive argument
townhall argument --type deductive --opens --position pro \
  "Premise 1: Human rights must be protected.
   Premise 2: Unregulated AI can violate rights.
   Conclusion: Therefore, AI must be regulated."

# Inductive argument with evidence
townhall argument --type inductive --responds-to arg_001 \
  "Evidence from 50 tech companies shows:
   - 80% experienced data breaches
   - 60% had algorithmic bias issues
   Pattern: Lack of oversight leads to harm"

# Output

   90% of AI systems operate safely without regulation."

# Logical rebuttal
townhall rebuttal --responds-to arg_002 --type logical \
  "Your conclusion doesn't follow. Correlation between
   regulation and safety isn't proven causation."

# Output
Created rebuttal: reb_9d4e5f2a

## Error Messages

Common errors and their meanings:

```bash
ERROR: Not in a simulation context
# Solution: Use 'townhall checkout <simulation>' first

ERROR: Invalid argument type 'informal'
# Solution: Use valid types: deductive, inductive, empirical, analogical, ethical

ERROR: Referenced argument 'arg_999' not found
# Solution: Check argument ID with 'townhall log'

ERROR: Stage does not allow this action
# Solution: Check current stage with 'townhall status'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always specify argument types** - This enables better analysis
2. **Link arguments properly** - Use --responds-to for clear relationships
3. **Add citations** - Support claims with evidence
4. **Use descriptive content** - Full arguments, not just summaries
5. **Check status regularly** - Know your simulation context
6. **Export periodically** - Save debate state for analysis
