# Git: Product Overview and Architecture

## Executive Summary

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development. It has become the de facto standard for version control, with ~95% of developers using it as their primary VCS as of 2022. Git's revolutionary architecture enables distributed development, ensures data integrity through content-addressable storage, and provides exceptional performance through its unique design principles.

## Historical Context

### Origin Story
- **Created**: April 2005 by Linus Torvalds
- **Catalyst**: Linux kernel developers lost access to proprietary BitKeeper tool due to licensing disputes
- **Development Speed**: Torvalds wrote enough of Git to use Git to commit to Git itself in just one day
- **Initial Performance**: Within weeks, Git was recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at 6.7 patches per second
- **Maintenance Transfer**: Torvalds handed over maintenance to Junio Hamano on July 26, 2005

### Design Philosophy
Torvalds established clear design criteria:
1. **Anti-CVS Philosophy**: Take CVS as an example of what NOT to do
2. **Performance First**: Patching should take no more than 3 seconds
3. **Distributed by Design**: Support BitKeeper-like distributed workflow
4. **Data Integrity**: Strong safeguards against corruption (accidental or malicious)
5. **No Special Trees**: Every clone is equal; no "blessed" central repository

## Core Architecture

### 1. Content-Addressable Storage System

Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface. Every piece of data is identified by its SHA-1 hash (SHA-256 in newer versions), which serves as both:
- **Unique identifier**: Guarantees uniqueness across all repositories
- **Integrity check**: Any corruption immediately detectable
- **Storage address**: Direct lookup in the object database

### 2. Object Model

Git stores all data as objects in `.git/objects/`, using four primary object types:

#### Blob Objects
- **Purpose**: Store file contents (no metadata like filename or permissions)
- **Structure**: Raw file data compressed with zlib
- **Addressing**: SHA-1 hash of header + content
- **Deduplication**: Same content always produces same hash, stored only once

#### Tree Objects
- **Purpose**: Represent directories and file organization
- **Structure**: List of entries containing:
  - File mode (permissions)
  - Object type (blob or tree)
  - SHA-1 hash of referenced object
  - Filename
- **Hierarchy**: Trees can reference other trees (subdirectories)

#### Commit Objects
- **Purpose**: Capture repository state at a point in time
- **Structure**:
  - Reference to root tree object
  - Parent commit(s) SHA-1 (except initial commit)
  - Author information (name, email, timestamp)
  - Committer information (may differ from author)
  - Commit message
- **Immutability**: Once created, commits never change

#### Tag Objects
- **Purpose**: Provide permanent references to specific commits
- **Structure**:
  - Reference to tagged object (usually commit)
  - Tag name
  - Tagger information
  - Tag message
  - Optional GPG signature

### 3. References System

Git uses references (refs) as human-readable pointers to commits:

#### Types of References
- **Branches**: Mutable pointers to commits (`refs/heads/`)
- **Remote branches**: Track remote repository states (`refs/remotes/`)
- **Tags**: Typically immutable markers (`refs/tags/`)
- **HEAD**: Special ref pointing to current branch
- **FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, MERGE_HEAD**: Special-purpose refs

#### Reference Storage
- **Loose refs**: Individual files in `.git/refs/`
- **Packed refs**: Compressed format in `.git/packed-refs` for efficiency

### 4. Index (Staging Area)

The index serves as a bridge between working directory and repository:
- **Binary file**: `.git/index`
- **Contents**: Sorted list of paths with:
  - File permissions
  - SHA-1 of blob object
  - File statistics for change detection
- **Purpose**: Build commits incrementally, track merge conflicts

## Storage Optimization

### Pack Files
Git periodically compresses objects for efficiency:
- **Trigger**: Too many loose objects, manual `git gc`, or push operations
- **Delta compression**: Similar objects stored as base + deltas
- **Algorithm**: Identifies similar files by name and size
- **Storage**: `.git/objects/pack/` directory
- **Index files**: Quick lookup into pack files

### Garbage Collection
Automatic maintenance through `git gc`:
- **Compression**: Loose objects into pack files
- **Pruning**: Unreachable objects (with grace period)
- **Reference packing**: Consolidate loose refs
- **Reflog cleanup**: Remove old reflog entries
- **Auto-trigger**: Based on configurable thresholds

## Network Protocols

### Protocol Types

#### Smart Protocol (Modern Standard)
- **Negotiation**: Client and server exchange capabilities
- **Efficiency**: Only transfers missing objects
- **Packfile generation**: Custom packfiles for each transfer
- **Bidirectional**: Supports both fetch and push

#### Dumb Protocol (Legacy)
- **Simple HTTP**: Series of GET requests
- **No server intelligence**: Client assumes repository layout
- **Read-only**: No push support
- **Inefficient**: May transfer unnecessary data

### Transport Mechanisms

#### SSH
- **Security**: Key-based authentication
- **Efficiency**: Uses smart protocol
- **Default port**: 22
- **Use case**: Authenticated read/write access

#### HTTPS
- **Authentication**: Username/password or tokens
- **Firewall friendly**: Uses standard ports (443)
- **Flexibility**: Can serve anonymous or authenticated
- **Smart HTTP**: Full functionality since Git 1.6.6

#### Git Protocol
- **Port**: 9418
- **Performance**: Fastest protocol
- **Security**: No authentication
- **Use case**: Anonymous read access

### Transfer Operations

#### Fetch/Pull
1. **Handshake**: Exchange protocol capabilities
2. **Reference discovery**: Server sends all refs
3. **Negotiation**: Client sends "want" and "have" lists
4. **Packfile transfer**: Server generates custom packfile
5. **Object unpacking**: Client stores received objects

#### Push
1. **Reference discovery**: Client learns server state
2. **Update proposal**: Client sends intended ref updates
3. **Object transfer**: Missing objects sent as packfile
4. **Reference update**: Server updates refs if allowed
5. **Hook execution**: Server-side hooks may accept/reject

## Command Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

#### Porcelain Commands (User-Facing)
- **Purpose**: User-friendly interface
- **Examples**: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- **Characteristics**: High-level abstractions, helpful output

#### Plumbing Commands (Low-Level)
- **Purpose**: Scripting and internal operations
- **Examples**: `git hash-object`, `git write-tree`, `git cat-file`
- **Characteristics**: Stable interface, machine-parseable output

### Implementation

#### Core Implementation (C)
- **Language**: C99 subset for portability
- **Structure**: Modular design with clear boundaries
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD, etc.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (zlib, optional libraries)

#### Libgit2 (Alternative Implementation)

## Conclusion

Git's architecture represents a masterclass in distributed systems design. By choosing content-addressable storage, immutable objects, and a distributed model, Torvalds created a system that is simultaneously simple in concept and powerful in practice. The architecture's elegance lies not in complexity but in how simple primitives combine to enable sophisticated version control workflows.

The key insight is that Git is not just a version control system but a content-addressable filesystem with version control as its user interface. This fundamental architecture has proven so robust and flexible that it has not only solved the original problem of Linux kernel development but has become the foundation for modern software development practices worldwide.
