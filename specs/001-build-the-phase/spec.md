# Feature Specification: Townhall Phase 1 MVP - Debate Simulation Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-the-phase`
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build the Phase 1 MVP foundation for Townhall - a Git-inspired CLI for structured agent debate simulations. Implement core debate commands (argument, rebuttal, concession) with support for different argument types (deductive, inductive, empirical). Enable agents to log structured arguments during debates, track relationships between arguments (what responds to what), and query the debate history. Store arguments using content-addressed storage like Git. Support basic operations: starting a debate simulation, making arguments, responding to other arguments, and viewing the debate log with relationships. Follow hexagonal architecture with clear separation between core domain logic, application use cases, infrastructure storage, and CLI interface."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-26
- Q: Can multiple debates be active simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Only one debate can be active at a time (system-wide)
- Q: How are agent identities established? ‚Üí A: Agents must be created as MD files with frontmatter
- Q: What format for argument references? ‚Üí A: Handled same as git (full SHA or short prefix)
- Q: How should debates be concluded? ‚Üí A: Consensus vote by participating agents
- Q: Minimum premises for deductive arguments? ‚Üí A: consult professional literature

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an AI agent participating in a structured debate, I want to log my arguments, respond to other agents' arguments, and track the debate flow, so that my contributions are recorded in a traceable and analyzable format that preserves the logical structure and relationships of the debate.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no debate exists, **When** a user initiates a new debate simulation with a topic, **Then** the system creates a new debate context and confirms readiness for agents to participate
2. **Given** an active debate simulation exists, **When** an agent submits a deductive argument with premises and conclusion, **Then** the system logs the argument with a unique identifier, timestamp, and agent attribution
3. **Given** existing arguments in a debate, **When** an agent creates a rebuttal referencing a specific prior argument, **Then** the system records the rebuttal and links it to the original argument
4. **Given** multiple arguments have been logged, **When** a user requests the debate history, **Then** the system displays all arguments in chronological order with their relationships and agent attributions
5. **Given** an active debate, **When** an agent concedes to another argument, **Then** the system records the concession and links it to the argument being conceded to
6. **Given** an active debate with multiple participating agents, **When** agents vote for closure and consensus is reached, **Then** the system closes the debate and prevents further arguments

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent attempts to respond to a non-existent argument ID?
- How does system handle malformed argument structure (missing premises in deductive argument)?
- What happens when trying to make an argument outside of an active debate context?
- How does system handle concurrent argument submissions from multiple agents?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initialize a new debate simulation with a topic name
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable agents to submit arguments with three supported types: deductive (with premises and conclusion), inductive (with observations and generalization), and empirical (with evidence and claim)
- **FR-003**: System MUST assign a unique, immutable identifier to each logged argument
- **FR-004**: System MUST track and preserve the agent identity for each argument submission (agents must be pre-created as MD files with frontmatter)
- **FR-005**: System MUST record precise timestamps for all argument submissions
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable agents to create rebuttals that explicitly reference and link to specific prior arguments using Git-style SHA references (supporting both full hash and short prefix)
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable agents to submit concessions that acknowledge and link to specific arguments using Git-style SHA references
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a command to view the complete debate history showing all arguments in chronological order
- **FR-009**: System MUST display argument relationships (what responds to what) in the debate log
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate argument structure based on type (e.g., deductive arguments require premises and conclusion, with premise count requirements based on professional literature standards)
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent agents from referencing non-existent arguments when creating rebuttals or concessions
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist all debate data using content-addressed storage where each argument's content determines its storage key
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain a single active debate context at a time to ensure arguments are associated with the correct simulation (only one debate can be active system-wide)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear error messages when agents attempt invalid operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure all logged arguments are immutable once created
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a mechanism for agents to vote on debate closure, requiring consensus from participating agents to conclude the debate

### Key Entities
- **Debate Simulation**: Represents an active debate context with a unique identifier, topic, creation time, and collection of related arguments
- **Argument**: Core entity representing an agent's contribution, containing content, type (deductive/inductive/empirical), agent identity, timestamp, and unique identifier
- **Agent**: Entity representing a debate participant defined as an MD file with frontmatter containing agent metadata, with a unique identity used for attribution
- **Rebuttal**: Specialized argument that maintains an explicit reference to the argument it challenges
- **Concession**: Acknowledgment by an agent that references and accepts another agent's argument
- **Argument Relationship**: Link between arguments showing response patterns (rebuttal-to, concession-to relationships)
